# Generic Army Example with Python

The task:
Using OOP create 2 armies. In each army there are a few types
of units like Mage, Archer, Knight or even more.
Each unit has general stats or stats only for a certain type.
Each army make a strike  to another (a unit from first one 
hits a unit from another army or healing).

In this particular task I have a lot of fun with OOP and was trying to make
this example closer to real world tasks.

Currently, I am trying to implement items system for the units
